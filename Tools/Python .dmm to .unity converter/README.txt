The script is not finished just creates the basic test map from Example.Unity
Put a .dmm file in the same folder as the script, it will convert it into a .txt and read the tile info.
It will then write the appropriate tile into the .unity file it will create.
Essential Data.txt is needed for it to create the HUD and game managers for the map.
NOTE: Anything related to the power systems (except APCs) will be ignored, same goes for atmospherics and moving objects like shuttles,
also you will need to rotate all wallmounts manually
