The script is not finished just creates the basic test map from Example.Unity
Put a .dmm file in the same folder as the script, it will convert it into a .txt and read the tile info.
It will then write the appropriate tile into the .unity file it will create.
Essential Data.txt is needed for it to create the HUD and game managers for the map.
NOTE: Anything related to the power systems (except APCs) will be ignored, same goes for atmospherics and moving objects like shuttles,
also you will need to rotate all wallmounts manually
Another NOTE: Due to me being lazy you have to set the defines of the tiles yourself! Better than messing with
that glitch tile pallet, some things might not need changing but since im working with the paracode id recommend
checking.
